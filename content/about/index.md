# About the team

[.hidden](/about) is a community of students from the [University of
Bucharest](https://fmi.unibuc.ro), passionate about hacking and cybersecurity.

We formed the team on the 28th of April 2023, once we randomly decided to take
part in a CTF competition. It all took off from there.

Our goal is to contribute to the local CTF and hacking scene by learning and
sharing our experiences with students of the University, as well as anyone else
that wants to join in on the fun.

We would love to expand the team!
